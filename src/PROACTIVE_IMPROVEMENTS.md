# Proactive Scheduling Improvements

## Key Fixes Applied

### 1. ❌ Removed Reward-Based Misprediction Penalty

**Problem**: Original implementation penalized the RL agent's reward when predictions were wrong. This doesn't help the predictor learn - it only confuses the policy.

**Solution**: Removed all reward penalties for mispredictions. The predictor now learns through its own correction mechanism.

```python
# BEFORE (Wrong):
if job_id not in self.arrived_jobs:
    misprediction_penalty = -10.0
    reward += misprediction_penalty  # This doesn't teach the predictor!

# AFTER (Correct):
reward = -(self.current_makespan - previous_makespan)  # Clean reward signal
# Predictor learns separately through correct_prediction()
```

### 2. ✅ Proper Cross-Episode Learning

**Problem**: Original implementation didn't properly leverage historical data from past 100 episodes. It stored inter-arrival times but didn't effectively use them for current predictions.

**Solution**: Redesigned `ArrivalPredictor` with explicit separation of:
- **Global historical data**: `global_inter_arrivals` - ALL observations from ALL past episodes
- **Current episode data**: `current_episode_inter_arrivals` - Observations from ongoing episode
- **Combined estimation**: Uses BOTH sources for current predictions

```python
# Key improvements in ArrivalPredictor:

class ArrivalPredictor:
    def __init__(self):
        # Stores ALL inter-arrival times from ALL episodes
        self.global_inter_arrivals = []  # This grows over training!
        
        # Current episode observations
        self.current_episode_inter_arrivals = []
    
    def _update_mle_estimate(self):
        """Uses BOTH historical AND current data"""
        # Combine all data
        all_data = self.global_inter_arrivals + self.current_episode_inter_arrivals
        
        # Optional: Weight recent data more
        if len(self.current_episode_inter_arrivals) >= 3:
            weighted_data = (self.global_inter_arrivals + 
                            self.current_episode_inter_arrivals * 2)
            mean = np.mean(weighted_data)
        else:
            mean = np.mean(all_data)
        
        self.current_estimated_rate = 1.0 / mean
```

### 3. ✅ Predictor Self-Correction Mechanism

**New Feature**: Added `correct_prediction()` method that updates the predictor when mispredictions occur.

```python
def correct_prediction(self, job_id, predicted_time, actual_time):
    """
    Learn from prediction errors.
    If we consistently predict too early/late, adjust the rate.
    """
    prediction_error = actual_time - predicted_time
    self.prediction_errors.append(prediction_error)
    
    # Detect systematic bias
    if len(self.prediction_errors) >= 5:
        mean_error = np.mean(self.prediction_errors[-20:])
        
        # Adjust rate based on bias
        if abs(mean_error) > 0.5:
            correction_factor = 1.0 - (mean_error / (1.0/self.current_estimated_rate)) * 0.1
            self.current_estimated_rate *= np.clip(correction_factor, 0.5, 2.0)
```

**Usage in Environment**:
```python
# In step() when scheduling proactively
if job_id not in self.arrived_jobs:
    actual_arrival = self.job_arrival_times[job_id]
    predicted_arrival = self.predicted_arrival_times[job_id]
    
    # Correct the predictor (NO reward penalty!)
    self.arrival_predictor.correct_prediction(
        job_id, predicted_arrival, actual_arrival
    )
```

### 4. ✅ Improved Prediction Anchoring

**Enhancement**: Predictions now anchor to the last known arrival time for better accuracy.

```python
def predict_next_arrivals(self, current_time, num_jobs_to_predict, last_known_arrival=None):
    """
    Predict future arrivals starting from last known arrival.
    This reduces error accumulation.
    """
    # Anchor to last known arrival if available
    if last_known_arrival is not None and last_known_arrival >= current_time:
        anchor_time = last_known_arrival
    elif len(self.current_episode_arrivals) > 0:
        anchor_time = self.current_episode_arrivals[-1]
    else:
        anchor_time = current_time
    
    # Predict from anchor
    predictions = []
    for i in range(1, num_jobs_to_predict + 1):
        predicted_time = anchor_time + i * mean_inter_arrival
        predictions.append(predicted_time)
    
    return predictions
```

## How Cross-Episode Learning Works Now

### Episode 1:
```
Jobs arrive at: [0, 8, 12, 16, 20]
Inter-arrivals: [8, 4, 4, 4]
global_inter_arrivals = [8, 4, 4, 4]
Estimated λ = 1 / mean([8,4,4,4]) = 1/5 = 0.20
```

### Episode 2:
```
Jobs arrive at: [0, 6, 10, 15, 22]
Inter-arrivals: [6, 4, 5, 7]
global_inter_arrivals = [8, 4, 4, 4, 6, 4, 5, 7]  # ACCUMULATED!
Estimated λ = 1 / mean([8,4,4,4,6,4,5,7]) = 1/5.25 = 0.19
```

### Episode 101:
```
global_inter_arrivals now has ~400 observations from past 100 episodes!

When predicting in episode 101:
- Start with λ estimated from ALL 400 observations
- As jobs arrive in episode 101, refine estimate by adding current observations
- Weighted combination gives more accurate predictions

Result: Episode 101 has MUCH better predictions than Episode 1!
```

## Confidence Evolution

The confidence metric now properly reflects accumulated knowledge:

```python
def get_confidence(self):
    total_observations = len(self.global_inter_arrivals)
    
    # Confidence grows with sqrt(observations) - diminishing returns
    confidence = 1.0 - np.exp(-np.sqrt(total_observations) / 5.0)
    
    # Episode 1:    ~10 obs  → 45% confidence
    # Episode 10:   ~50 obs  → 76% confidence
    # Episode 100:  ~400 obs → 96% confidence
    return np.clip(confidence, 0.0, 1.0)
```

## Statistics Tracking

Enhanced stats provide more insight:

```python
stats = predictor.get_stats()
# Returns:
{
    'estimated_rate': 0.082,           # Current estimate (with episode data)
    'global_rate': 0.080,              # Pure historical estimate
    'num_global_observations': 387,    # Total across all episodes
    'num_current_observations': 4,     # In current episode only
    'confidence': 0.96,                # Based on total observations
    'mean_inter_arrival': 12.2,
    'mean_prediction_error': -0.3      # Systematic bias tracking
}
```

## Expected Behavior

### Early Training (Episodes 1-50):
- Very few global observations
- Low confidence (< 60%)
- Agent learns to be conservative
- Mostly reactive scheduling

### Mid Training (Episodes 50-200):
- Growing global database
- Increasing confidence (60-85%)
- Agent starts proactive scheduling
- Predictor self-corrects from errors

### Late Training (Episodes 200+):
- Rich historical data (1000+ observations)
- High confidence (> 90%)
- Accurate predictions
- Aggressive proactive scheduling
- Performance should exceed reactive Dynamic RL

## Testing the Improvements

To verify cross-episode learning is working:

```python
# Add to training callback
class ProactiveTrainingCallback(EnhancedTrainingCallback):
    def _on_rollout_end(self):
        super()._on_rollout_end()
        
        env = self.model.get_env().envs[0]
        stats = env.arrival_predictor.get_stats()
        
        print(f"\nEpisode {self.num_timesteps // 1024}:")
        print(f"  Global observations: {stats['num_global_observations']}")
        print(f"  Estimated rate: {stats['estimated_rate']:.4f}")
        print(f"  Confidence: {stats['confidence']:.2%}")
        print(f"  Mean error: {stats['mean_prediction_error']:.2f}")
```

Expected output:
```
Episode 10:
  Global observations: 42
  Estimated rate: 0.0750
  Confidence: 58%
  Mean error: -0.8

Episode 100:
  Global observations: 410
  Estimated rate: 0.0798
  Confidence: 95%
  Mean error: -0.1

Episode 200:
  Global observations: 820
  Estimated rate: 0.0801
  Confidence: 98%
  Mean error: 0.0
```

## Key Takeaways

1. **No Reward Penalties**: Predictor learns from corrections, not RL rewards
2. **Cumulative Learning**: Each episode adds to global knowledge base
3. **Adaptive Estimation**: Combines historical + current data
4. **Self-Correction**: Detects and fixes systematic biases
5. **Confidence-Based**: Agent can make informed proactive decisions

This design properly implements the concept of "using past 100 episodes to predict in episode 101"!
