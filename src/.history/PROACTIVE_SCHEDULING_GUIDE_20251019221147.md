# Proactive Scheduling Implementation Guide

## Overview

This implementation adds **proactive scheduling** capabilities to your FJSP environment. The key innovation is that the agent learns to **predict future job arrivals** using Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) and can **schedule jobs proactively** before they actually arrive.

## Key Components

### 1. ArrivalPredictor Class

**Location**: Lines ~70-200 in `proactive_sche.py`

**Purpose**: Learns the arrival rate Œª from observed inter-arrival times using MLE.

**Key Features**:
- **Cross-Episode Learning**: Accumulates observations across all training episodes
- **Within-Episode Learning**: Updates predictions as jobs arrive during current episode
- **MLE for Poisson Process**: ŒªÃÇ = 1 / mean(inter-arrival times)
- **Confidence Tracking**: Returns confidence level (0-1) based on number of observations

**Key Methods**:
```python
# Reset for new episode (keeps cross-episode knowledge)
predictor.reset_episode()

# Observe a new arrival (updates MLE immediately)
predictor.observe_arrival(arrival_time)

# Predict next N arrivals
predictions = predictor.predict_next_arrivals(current_time, num_jobs)

# Get prediction confidence (0-1 scale)
confidence = predictor.get_confidence()

# Called at episode end for cross-episode learning
predictor.finalize_episode(all_arrival_times)
```

### 2. ProactiveDynamicFJSPEnv Class

**Location**: Lines ~202-600 in `proactive_sche.py`

**Purpose**: Environment that integrates arrival prediction and allows proactive scheduling.

**Key Parameters**:
- `prediction_window`: Time horizon for proactive scheduling (default: 10.0)
  - Jobs predicted to arrive within this window can be scheduled
  - Larger window = more proactive but higher misprediction risk
  
**Enhanced Observation Space**:
```python
Standard features (same as reactive):
- Ready job indicators
- Machine idle status  
- Processing times for next operations
- Job progress

NEW proactive features:
- Predicted arrival times (normalized, relative to current time)
- Prediction confidence per job
- Estimated arrival rate
```

**Proactive Action Masking**:
```python
# Traditional: Job has arrived
if job_id in self.arrived_jobs:
    can_schedule = True

# PROACTIVE: Job predicted to arrive within window
elif job_id in self.predicted_arrival_times:
    predicted_time = self.predicted_arrival_times[job_id]
    if predicted_time <= self.event_time + self.prediction_window:
        can_schedule = True  # Allow proactive scheduling
```

**Reward Shaping**:
```python
# Standard reward: minimize makespan
reward = -(self.current_makespan - previous_makespan)

# Misprediction penalty: if scheduled before actual arrival
if job_id not in self.arrived_jobs:
    actual_arrival = self.job_arrival_times[job_id]
    if actual_arrival > start_time:
        misprediction_penalty = -10.0
        reward += misprediction_penalty
```

### 3. Training Function

**Location**: `train_proactive_agent()` in `proactive_sche.py`

**Usage**:
```python
proactive_model = train_proactive_agent(
    jobs_data=ENHANCED_JOBS_DATA,
    machine_list=MACHINE_LIST,
    initial_jobs=[0, 1, 2],
    arrival_rate=0.08,  # TRUE rate (hidden from agent)
    prediction_window=10.0,  # Time horizon
    total_timesteps=400000,
    reward_mode="makespan_increment",
    learning_rate=3e-4
)
```

**Special Features**:
- Custom callback tracks predictor learning
- Prints final statistics comparing learned vs. true rate
- Uses identical hyperparameters to other RL methods for fair comparison

### 4. Evaluation Function

**Location**: `evaluate_proactive_on_dynamic()` in `proactive_sche.py`

**Usage**:
```python
makespan, schedule = evaluate_proactive_on_dynamic(
    proactive_model=model,
    jobs_data=ENHANCED_JOBS_DATA,
    machine_list=MACHINE_LIST,
    arrival_times=test_scenario_arrivals,
    prediction_window=10.0
)
```

**Tracks**:
- Number of proactive scheduling decisions
- Predictor final statistics
- Schedule completeness verification

## Mathematical Foundation

### MLE for Poisson Process

Given observed inter-arrival times: œÑ‚ÇÅ, œÑ‚ÇÇ, ..., œÑ‚Çô

**MLE estimate of rate**:
```
ŒªÃÇ = n / Œ£·µ¢ œÑ·µ¢ = 1 / mean(œÑ)
```

**Prediction of next arrival**:
```
E[next arrival | last = t] = t + 1/ŒªÃÇ
```

### Learning Evolution

**Episode 1-100** (Exploration):
- Very few observations ‚Üí Poor predictions
- Agent learns to be conservative
- Mostly waits for actual arrivals

**Episode 100-1000** (Refinement):
- Predictor improves with data
- Agent starts proactive scheduling
- Balances risk vs. reward

**Episode 1000+** (Exploitation):
- Accurate predictions
- Aggressive proactive scheduling
- Near-optimal performance expected

## Expected Performance Hierarchy

```
MILP Optimal ‚â§ Perfect Knowledge RL ‚â§ Proactive RL ‚â§ Dynamic RL ‚â§ Static RL
     ‚îÇ                  ‚îÇ                   ‚îÇ              ‚îÇ            ‚îÇ
  Baseline          Knows exact        Learns to        Knows        No arrival
  (optimal)      arrival times         predict        distribution    info
```

**Key Hypothesis**: Proactive RL should outperform reactive Dynamic RL by 5-15% after sufficient training.

## Running the Implementation

### Step 1: Training
```python
# In main() function, proactive model is trained after static RL
proactive_model = train_proactive_agent(...)
```

### Step 2: Evaluation
```python
# Evaluated on same test scenarios as other methods
proactive_makespan, proactive_schedule = evaluate_proactive_on_dynamic(
    proactive_model, jobs_data, machine_list, arrival_times, prediction_window
)
```

### Step 3: Comparison
Results are automatically included in:
- Average performance tables
- Gantt charts for all scenarios
- Regret analysis
- Performance ranking

## Key Differences from Reactive Scheduling

| Feature | Reactive (Dynamic RL) | Proactive (Proactive RL) |
|---------|----------------------|--------------------------|
| **Information** | Knows arrival distribution | Learns arrival rate via MLE |
| **Scheduling** | Only arrived jobs | Arrived + predicted jobs |
| **Learning** | Within episode only | Cross-episode + within-episode |
| **Action Mask** | Binary (arrived/not) | Window-based (predicted time) |
| **Observation** | Current state | + predictions + confidence |
| **Risk** | Zero | Misprediction penalty |

## Hyperparameters

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `prediction_window` | 10.0 | Time horizon for proactive scheduling |
| `initial_rate_guess` | 0.05 | Starting estimate of Œª |
| `misprediction_penalty` | -10.0 | Reward penalty for wrong predictions |
| `total_timesteps` | 400000 | Same as dynamic RL for fair comparison |

## Debugging Tips

### 1. Check Predictor Learning
```python
# After training, check final stats
stats = env.arrival_predictor.get_stats()
print(f"True rate: {arrival_rate}")
print(f"Learned rate: {stats['estimated_rate']}")
print(f"Error: {abs(arrival_rate - stats['estimated_rate'])}")
print(f"Confidence: {stats['confidence']}")
```

### 2. Track Proactive Decisions
```python
# During evaluation
proactive_decisions = 0
for each action:
    if action is for unarrived job:
        proactive_decisions += 1
print(f"Proactive decisions: {proactive_decisions}")
```

### 3. Verify Predictions
```python
# In environment
print(f"Current time: {self.event_time}")
print(f"Predictions: {self.predicted_arrival_times}")
print(f"Actual arrivals: {self.job_arrival_times}")
```

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: Predictor Not Learning
**Symptom**: Estimated rate stays at initial guess (0.05)
**Solution**: 
- Check that `finalize_episode()` is called after each episode
- Verify inter-arrival times are being recorded
- Increase training episodes

### Issue 2: Too Many Mispredictions
**Symptom**: Negative rewards, poor performance
**Solution**:
- Reduce `prediction_window` (e.g., 5.0 instead of 10.0)
- Increase `misprediction_penalty` to encourage conservatism
- Ensure confidence is properly integrated into observations

### Issue 3: No Proactive Decisions
**Symptom**: Agent never schedules predicted jobs
**Solution**:
- Increase `prediction_window`
- Reduce `misprediction_penalty`
- Check that predicted jobs are in action mask

## Extensions and Future Work

1. **Bayesian Learning**: Use posterior distributions instead of point estimates
2. **Job-Specific Rates**: Different Œª for different job types
3. **Confidence Intervals**: Schedule only within 95% confidence bounds
4. **Adaptive Window**: Adjust `prediction_window` based on confidence
5. **Multi-Step Prediction**: Predict multiple future arrivals simultaneously

## Example Output

```
